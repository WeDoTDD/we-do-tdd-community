### Workspace Administrators
Refers to the administrators of this online community.  You may reach out to any of them for help.

Current administrators are the following folks in our slack workspace:

- _List to be added soon_

## ‚ù§Ô∏è A Psychologically Safe and Diverse Community for All
We recognize we're not all perfect 100% of the time, we're human, but that we guardrails to help keep us safe in here.

### üë• Diversity
This is an intentionally anti-sexist, anti-racist, anti-homophobic, anti-transphobic, anti-ablest, anti-discrimination, and anti-harassment space. We value inclusion through and through!

### üò° I have a problem with someone in this slack!
Instead of lashing out at the person in channels, we ask that you please DM Dave Schinkel or one of the workspace administrators.  We'll help you.

Likewise if you think the owner of this workspace (Dave Schinkel) is ever out of line, he can totally take it, DM and tell him how you feel!  He will listen and have a heart to heard direct and personal convo with you on it.

### üö´ Harassment
Our community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community event, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the slack Workspace.

Be nice, be inclusive and don‚Äôt spam or harass.

Includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Includes sexually suggestive phrases, slang, or jokes, that may be offensive.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event or community.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a WeDoTDD slack admin immediately.

### üö´ Government / Party Politics
This is a political free zone.  We don't care about what party or government association you have.  It's a waste of time and we do not talk about what party you are affiliated with, nor do we want threads that talk about global politics in this community.  Just keep it to yourself.

### ‚úÖ Passion for the Craft
It's fine to have strong opinions in here. That's what passion is.  If we can't be passionate even strongly, then what's the point of having a community.

Just don't be rude about it.  It's ok to argue about code approaches, and even argue strongly for different approaches.  It's ok to be yourself as long as you're not outright demeaning or rude to one another when you have these passionate arguments.

Examples that are strong, but fine:
 - "I think it's stupid that people say they're practicing TDD but many do not refactor"
 - "Yea, I personally hate writing a bunch of e2e tests.  I think they're a complete waste of time"
 - "Stupid interviews I've had recently.  Can you believe they had me do XYZ!"

Examples that are not ok:
 - "Dave you're an idiot, why do you like end to end tests!  Haven't you learned by now that those are painful?"
 - "wtf is wrong with you!  Nobody even uses that language anymore"

### üì∫ Can I create a channel?
While some slack workspaces create tons of channels we try to maintain just a few.  This keeps things simple.  We rarely add new channels, but there have been some rare times we have added new ones.

If you think a new channel would benefit the community, reach out to Dave Schinkel once you are signed in.  DM him and share your idea for the new channel and why.   

### üíº Can I post a job opportunity?
Yes, if you work for the company or are not a third party recruiter.  We prefer opportunities to be posted from someone working at the company or a fellow Software Crafter who knows about an opportunity.

We are not looking for just any job posting to be shared.  Job postings **must be related strongly to Extreme Programming and Software as a Craft**.  The team must foster a work culture that embraces Practices such as Test Driven Development, Clean Code, etc.

### üóì Can I post about an upcoming or past Event?
_(either I am holding the event, or someone else is)_

Of course!  As long as it's related to Software Craftsmanship or Extreme Programming either directly or indirectly supporting software as a craft or XP.

Please post it in the `#events` slack channel

### üìö Can I post about my Book, my Blog Post, my Training?
Of course!  As long as it's related to Software Craftsmanship or Extreme Programming either directly or indirectly supporting software as a craft or XP.

Please post it in the `#general` or `#events` slack channel

### ü§¨ Can I swear?
Shit yea you can!  But within reason.

It's probably smart not to do it constantly as it might not reflect the best on you (you make your own judgement call about how you want to be seen).  We don't outright encourage it, but we're all adults. Be aware that this may happen in here.  If you don't like swearing please speak up to one of the admins if it's starting to really bother you in the workspace.

As long as it's not used to harass someone, is used in a sexual nature, directed toward someone, and doesn't cross the line based on what we stated in the rest of this Code of Conduct, we'll most likely let it slide.

Now if there is excessive swearing, the admins may DM you and politely ask you to tone it down a bit.

### üí∞ Can I Sell?
Of course!  As long as it's related directly to Software Craftsmanship or Extreme Programming either directly or indirectly supporting software as a craft or XP.
Examples:  
- "Hey Folks, I'm providing new training on TDD, sign up here!"
- "Hey Folks, I just launched an ew book about _<TDD, XP, refactoring, clean code, or whatever>_.  You can get it here!"
- "Hey Folks, I created a new TDD board game, get yours now!"
- etc.
